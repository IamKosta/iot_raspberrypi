## Access Raspberry Pi without connecting it to a monitor.

Sometimes you need to access a Raspberry Pi without connecting it to a monitor. Perhaps the Pi is embedded in something like a robot, or you may want to view some information from it from elsewhere. Maybe you simply don't have a spare monitor! You can find more information on accessing your Raspberry Pi remotely here.
